# select-algorithm-dotnet

**C# / .NET**. Compare IVF, HNSW, and DiskANN against cosine, L2, and inner-product metrics: nine combinations with sequential index creation, search, and removal.

Standalone extraction of [the upstream sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/documentdb-samples/tree/f5a2675bbf349737234d0391e3ebee24b260e06f/ai/select-algorithm-dotnet). See [UPSTREAM.md](UPSTREAM.md) for attribution, exact revision, changes, and maintenance policy.

## Before you run

Use **.NET 8 SDK**, Git, and Azure CLI or another supported Azure Identity sign-in mechanism.
Use an existing, explicitly approved disposable Azure DocumentDB environment and an Azure OpenAI embedding deployment compatible with `text-embedding-3-small` and 1536-dimensional vectors.
Your identity needs appropriate model access and a registered DocumentDB database identity with permissions for the sample operations. Network access must be configured deliberately; signing in alone does not grant database access.

**These are cloud-mutating samples, not production services or read-only demos.** They can create/drop indexes, replace/drop collections, and invoke billable models. Some programs hardcode `Hotels` or collection names; an environment-variable change alone is not a universal isolation guarantee.

Upstream documentation differs on minimum DiskANN tiers and model/API versions. Confirm current service requirements for your selected region and tier; the shared provisioning template currently chooses M40. Do not infer live readiness from source code, saved output, or syntax/build CI.

## Setup

Commands below use PowerShell and run from this repository root. They are instructions for a separately approved run; no live run is claimed by this extraction.

### 1. Retrieve the pinned sample data

Follow [data/README.md](data/README.md). It provides explicit downloads, source links, and SHA-256 checks. No data download or model call happens automatically on clone or install.

### 2. Configure the sample

The checked-in `appsettings.json` contains placeholders and local data paths. Keep real values out of Git by using process environment overrides. Replace every placeholder:

```powershell
$env:AzureOpenAI__Endpoint = 'https://<your-openai-resource>.openai.azure.com/'
$env:AzureOpenAI__EmbeddingModel = '<embedding-deployment-name>'
$env:DocumentDB__ClusterName = '<your-cluster-name>'
$env:DocumentDB__DatabaseName = 'Hotels'
```

A placeholder-only [`.env.example`](.env.example) lists every overridable key. Copy it to `.env` and fill it in:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Note that .NET does **not** read `.env` files automatically. Either export the values into the process first (`set -a; source .env; set +a` on bash/zsh) or set the variables directly as shown above. `.env` is git-ignored; `.env.example` must stay placeholder-only.

For an interactive passwordless run, sign in to the intended Azure identity with `az login`; confirm the resource permissions and database identity independently.

### 3. Install/build when you are ready

```powershell
dotnet restore
dotnet build --no-restore
```

### 4. Run only against the approved disposable environment

```powershell
dotnet run --no-build
```

This compares search behavior on a small fixture, not production-scale performance. All nine combinations are attempted; use a tier supporting all three algorithms. Precomputed document vectors do not eliminate the live query-embedding call.

## Shared provisioning

Provisioning remains [upstream](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/documentdb-samples/tree/f5a2675bbf349737234d0391e3ebee24b260e06f/infra), not duplicated here. If you choose azd, use a separate checkout of the [upstream repository root](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/documentdb-samples/blob/f5a2675bbf349737234d0391e3ebee24b260e06f/README.md), not this sample directory.
Review and harden its broad firewall/admin defaults and fallback administrator password before any deployment. No infrastructure, cloud credentials, GitHub Actions workflows, or automatic deployments are included in this extraction.

## Maintenance and license

This is a standalone downstream snapshot, not a GitHub fork of the complete monorepo. Upstream fixes must be reviewed and ported manually; update the recorded revision in [UPSTREAM.md](UPSTREAM.md) when doing so.
Dependencies and sample algorithms are retained from the pinned source. Static extraction checks do not certify dependency compatibility, authentication, deployment, or model behavior.
